# EMPLOYEE-ATTRITION-PREDICTION-USING-SUPERVISED-MACHINE-LEARNING-MODELS


In the realm of data science, people analytics takes center stage in addressing the pervasive challenge of employee attrition for organizations. Employing a deep data approach that prioritizes quality over quantity, we present a predictive model crafted to forecast employee attrition. Beginning with an extensive exploration of features, we transition to a focused, data-driven method. This involves surveys and selection algorithms to identify key factors influencing attrition. Our goal is to equip HR managers with invaluable insights to bolster talent retention strategies and navigate the risks associated with workforce turnover.

### Objective

Organizations are striving to redefine talent strategies to mitigate attrition risks. This project treats employee attrition as a supervised learning problem, employing binary classification to detect and confirm an employee's intention to leave. Our objective is to develop a robust attrition model, utilizing a deep data-driven approach and supervised machine learning classifiers, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. The aim is to pinpoint key features influencing attrition, offering actionable insights for talent management.

### Research Goal and Contributions

This research strives to empower HR managers with early detection capabilities for employee intention to leave through predictive analytics. Key contributions include:

1. **New Attrition Model:** Introducing a novel model with essential features for detecting and predicting positive attrition, utilizing a mixed research methodology.

2. **Predictive Models:** Presenting machine, deep, and ensemble learning models, experimentally assessing their performance to guide HR decision-making.

3. **Interpretation and Explanation:** Providing insights to help HR managers understand factors influencing employee attrition, enabling the adoption of effective retention policies.

### Study Limitations and Future Directions

- **Dynamic Features:** Consideration of dynamic features related to employee behavior and emotional states for a more comprehensive study.
- **Online Training:** Acknowledging the potential of on-line training for predictive models with dynamic data.
- **Additional Features:** Future studies may include health issues, job security, and technology usage.
- **Unbalanced Data Challenge:** Recognizing the challenge of dealing with unbalanced data, especially in organizations with high turnover rates, and exploring suitable predictive models for such scenarios.
